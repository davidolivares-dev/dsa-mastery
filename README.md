# DSA Mastery (Kotlin)

This repository documents my structured journey to rebuild and deepen my understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms using Kotlin.

The goal is not to solve as many problems as possible.

The goal is to build durable pattern recognition, clean implementation skills, and strong complexity intuition.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Over time, I am intentionally strengthening:

- Core data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs)
- Algorithmic patterns (two pointers, sliding window, recursion, DFS/BFS, etc.)
- Time and space complexity reasoning
- Problem-solving clarity
- Idiomatic Kotlin implementation

This is long-term skill development — not short-term interview cramming.

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

Random problem grinding does not build intuition.

Instead, this repository follows a pattern-based approach:

1. Study a single algorithmic pattern.
2. Solve several representative problems.
3. Extract the underlying principle.
4. Distill a reusable mental model.
5. Move forward only after mastery signals are met.

The emphasis is on:

- Recognition cues (how to identify the right pattern)
- Complexity tradeoffs
- Clean, readable Kotlin
- Understanding why a solution works

---

## 🛠 Approach

Each pattern explored includes:

- Core intuition
- Recognition signals
- Kotlin implementation template
- Representative problems
- Extracted pattern summary
- Common pitfalls
- Complexity analysis

This builds an internal “algorithmic library” over time.

---

## 📈 Progress Model

Progress is measured by:

- Clarity of reasoning
- Ability to explain patterns
- Writing clean implementations from memory
- Reducing brute-force thinking
- Increasing speed through recognition, not memorization

This repository will evolve as patterns are revisited and refined.

---

## 🚀 Long-Term Goal

To build strong, intuitive algorithmic thinking that supports:

- Technical interviews
- Backend engineering work
- System design reasoning
- General computational problem solving

Consistency over intensity.

Depth over volume.
