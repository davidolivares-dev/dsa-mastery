# DSA Mastery Roadmap

A phased learning plan for mastering algorithmic patterns. Work through each phase in order — each builds on the previous one.

Pace: ~1 pattern per 1-2 weeks at 2-3 hours/week.

## Progress

### Phase 1: Fundamentals
Arrays, strings, and hashmaps. The foundation everything else builds on.

- [ ] [Frequency Counting / Hashmaps](phase-1-fundamentals.md#frequency-counting--hashmaps)
- [ ] [Two Pointers (Same Direction)](phase-1-fundamentals.md#two-pointers-same-direction)
- [ ] [Two Pointers (Opposite Direction)](phase-1-fundamentals.md#two-pointers-opposite-direction)

### Phase 2: Core Patterns
The patterns that appear in 60%+ of medium-difficulty problems.

- [ ] [Sliding Window (Fixed Size)](phase-2-core-patterns.md#sliding-window-fixed-size)
- [ ] [Sliding Window (Variable Size)](phase-2-core-patterns.md#sliding-window-variable-size)
- [ ] [Binary Search](phase-2-core-patterns.md#binary-search)
- [ ] [Monotonic Stack](phase-2-core-patterns.md#monotonic-stack)

### Phase 3: Trees & Graphs
Recursive thinking and traversal. Requires comfort with Phase 1-2 patterns.

- [ ] [Recursion & Backtracking](phase-3-trees-and-graphs.md#recursion--backtracking)
- [ ] [BFS](phase-3-trees-and-graphs.md#bfs)
- [ ] [DFS](phase-3-trees-and-graphs.md#dfs)
- [ ] [Binary Tree Patterns](phase-3-trees-and-graphs.md#binary-tree-patterns)
- [ ] [Graph Traversal](phase-3-trees-and-graphs.md#graph-traversal)

### Phase 4: Advanced
Dynamic programming, heaps, and specialized data structures.

- [ ] [Dynamic Programming (1D)](phase-4-advanced.md#dynamic-programming-1d)
- [ ] [Dynamic Programming (2D)](phase-4-advanced.md#dynamic-programming-2d)
- [ ] [Heap / Priority Queue](phase-4-advanced.md#heap--priority-queue)
- [ ] [Trie](phase-4-advanced.md#trie)
- [ ] [Union-Find](phase-4-advanced.md#union-find)
- [ ] [Topological Sort](phase-4-advanced.md#topological-sort)

### Phase 5: Synthesis
Mixed practice and interview readiness. No new patterns — combine what you've learned.

- [ ] [Multi-pattern problems](phase-5-synthesis.md)
- [ ] [Timed mock sessions](phase-5-synthesis.md)
- [ ] [Revisit weak areas](phase-5-synthesis.md)
