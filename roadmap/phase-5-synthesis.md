# Phase 5: Synthesis

No new patterns. This phase is about combining patterns, building speed, and identifying gaps under pressure.

**Prerequisites:** Comfortable with all Phase 1-4 patterns.

## Multi-Pattern Problems

Problems that combine two or more patterns. The goal is recognizing which patterns apply and how they fit together.

| # | Problem | Difficulty | Patterns Combined |
|---|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| 1 | Word Search (LC 79) | Medium | DFS + backtracking on grid |
| 2 | Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree (LC 297) | Hard | BFS/DFS + string processing |
| 3 | Shortest Path in Binary Matrix (LC 1091) | Medium | BFS + grid traversal |
| 4 | Network Delay Time (LC 743) | Medium | Graph + heap (Dijkstra's) |
| 5 | Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix (LC 329) | Hard | DFS + memoization (DP on grid) |
| 6 | Word Ladder II (LC 126) | Hard | BFS + backtracking |

## Timed Practice

Simulate interview conditions:
- Pick a random medium problem you haven't seen
- Set a 25-minute timer
- Solve without looking anything up
- If stuck after 10 minutes, identify the pattern and try again
- After solving (or failing), review your approach

Track your solve rate and common failure points.

## Revisit Weak Areas

After working through timed practice, you'll notice patterns where you struggle. Go back to those phase files and:

1. Re-read your pattern notes in `patterns/<name>/notes.md`
2. Solve 2-3 new problems for that pattern
3. Run `/reflect <pattern-name>` to reassess

## When Are You Done?

You've reached a strong level when:
- [ ] You can identify the right pattern within 2-3 minutes of reading a new problem
- [ ] You can solve most mediums in under 25 minutes
- [ ] You can explain your approach and complexity clearly
- [ ] You can adapt when your first approach doesn't work
- [ ] You can discuss tradeoffs between alternative solutions

This isn't a destination — revisit patterns periodically to maintain sharpness.
