# Using This Repo as a Template

This repo is designed to be forked and personalized. Here's how to make it your own.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork this repo** (or clone and create a new repo)
2. **Review the roadmap** in `roadmap/README.md` — adjust phases to match your level
3. **Set up Claude Code** — the commands and `CLAUDE.md` are designed for Claude Code
4. **Follow the weekly flow** described in `CLAUDE.md`
5. **Fill in your notes** in `patterns/` as you learn each pattern

## Customizing

**Different language?** The roadmap and patterns are language-agnostic. Replace the Kotlin references in the commands and CLAUDE.md with your language of choice. Change `.kt` file extensions to `.py`, `.java`, `.go`, etc.

**Different pace?** The suggested pace is 1 pattern per 1-2 weeks at 2-3 hours/week. Adjust to your schedule — consistency matters more than speed.

**Different patterns?** Add or remove patterns from the roadmap. Create new pattern directories by copying `patterns/_template/`.

**Different AI?** The commands are designed for Claude Code but the structure and workflow are what matter. Adapt as needed for other tools.

## Structure

```
roadmap/     → Your learning plan (what to study and when)
.claude/     → Slash commands for Claude Code learning sessions
patterns/    → Your reference library (filled in as you learn)
templates/   → This file + templates for weekly logs
log/         → Optional learning journal
```
