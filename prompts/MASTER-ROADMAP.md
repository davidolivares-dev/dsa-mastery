# DSA Master Roadmap Prompt

You are a senior algorithms instructor and systems-minded engineer.

Context:

- I am a backend engineer learning Kotlin.
- I want to strengthen problem-solving skills and DSA fundamentals.
- I want structured coverage of core and advanced data structures.
- I can dedicate 2–3 hours per week.
- I want pattern mastery, not random LeetCode grinding.
- I care about deep understanding over speed.

Design a sustainable, phase-based roadmap that:

1. Groups problems by pattern.
2. Builds intuition progressively.
3. Emphasizes when and why to use each data structure.
4. Includes representative LeetCode problems per pattern.
5. Encourages writing clean Kotlin.
6. Defines mastery signals before moving on.
7. Avoids overwhelming scope.

Optimize for long-term retention and algorithmic confidence.
