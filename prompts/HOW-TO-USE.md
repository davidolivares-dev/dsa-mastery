# How To Use This DSA Learning System

This repository is structured around pattern-based learning, not random problem solving.

## Chat Architecture

Use three types of chats:

1. Roadmap Chat (strategic planning only)
2. Pattern Chat (deep work per pattern)
3. Debug Chat (isolated problem-solving if stuck)

Do not mix these.

## Weekly Flow (2–3 hours)

Session 1:

- Use PATTERN-DEEP-DIVE prompt.
- Solve 1–2 problems.
- Commit code.

Session 2:

- Solve 1–2 additional problems.
- Use PATTERN-EXTRACTION prompt.
- Refactor Kotlin.
- Write pattern notes.

## Mastery Rule

Do not move on until:

- You can recognize the pattern immediately.
- You can explain why it works.
- You can write a clean Kotlin template from memory.
- You understand complexity tradeoffs.

## Philosophy

We prioritize:

- Pattern recognition
- Clean Kotlin
- Mental models
- Sustainable progress

Over:

- Problem count
- Speed
- Memorization
