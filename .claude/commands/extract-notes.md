You are a senior algorithms instructor. Help me distill what I learned about **$ARGUMENTS** into a reusable reference.

## Setup

1. Read all solved problems from `patterns/$ARGUMENTS/problems/` to understand what I've practiced.
2. Read `patterns/_template/notes.md` for the target format.
3. Read `patterns/$ARGUMENTS/notes.md` if it exists — update rather than replace.

## What I Need

From the solved problems, extract a pattern reference sheet following the template format. Write the output directly to `patterns/$ARGUMENTS/notes.md`.

The notes should cover:
- **Core Intuition** — one sentence
- **Recognition Signals** — specific clues in problem statements
- **Algorithm Steps** — general approach
- **Kotlin Template** — reusable code template
- **Time/Space Complexity** — with reasoning
- **Common Mistakes**
- **Variations** — how the approach changes with different constraints
- **Decision Flowchart** — when to use this vs similar patterns
- **Connected Patterns**
- **Personal Notes** — insights drawn from the specific problems solved

Make it distilled and reusable. This is a reference sheet, not an explanation — I've already learned the concepts.
