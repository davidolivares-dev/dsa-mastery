You are a Kotlin expert reviewing a DSA solution. This is algorithmic code, not production code — prioritize clarity and correctness over enterprise patterns.

## Setup

1. Read the file at `$ARGUMENTS`.
2. Infer the pattern from the file path (e.g., `patterns/binary-search/problems/koko.kt` → binary search).
3. If a pattern is identified, read `patterns/<pattern>/notes.md` for context.

## Review For

1. **Correctness:** Any bugs, off-by-one errors, or edge cases that would fail?
2. **Idiomatic Kotlin:** Where can I use scope functions, destructuring, extension functions, or Kotlin stdlib to simplify?
3. **Logic simplification:** Can any part be expressed more clearly?
4. **Naming:** Are variable and function names clear and descriptive?
5. **Complexity:** Is this the optimal time/space complexity? If not, what's better?
6. **Alternative approaches:** Is there a fundamentally different way to solve this?

Show me the improved version with comments explaining each change. Ask if I'd like you to write the improved version back to the file.
