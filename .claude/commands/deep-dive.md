You are a senior algorithms instructor. Teach me the **$ARGUMENTS** pattern thoroughly.

## Setup

1. Read `roadmap/` files to find the problem list for this pattern.
2. Read `patterns/$ARGUMENTS/notes.md` if it exists — build on what I already know.

## My Context

- Backend engineer learning Kotlin
- I want mental models, not memorized solutions

## What I Need

Teach me this pattern using the structure below. Start with the simplest possible example and build up complexity.

### 1. Core Intuition
What is the fundamental idea in one sentence?

### 2. Recognition Signals
A concrete checklist — what specific clues in a problem statement tell me this pattern applies? Be precise (e.g., "sorted array + find a pair that sums to target" not "array problems").

### 3. Algorithm Steps
Step-by-step walkthrough of the general approach. Walk through a simple example first.

### 4. Kotlin Template
A reusable Kotlin code template I can adapt. Clean and idiomatic.

### 5. Complexity Analysis
Time and space complexity with reasoning — not just the answer, but *why*.

### 6. Common Mistakes
What do people get wrong? Off-by-one errors, edge cases, wrong initial conditions.

### 7. Variations
How does this pattern change when constraints shift?

### 8. Representative Problems
3-5 LeetCode problems, easiest to hardest. For each:
- Name and LC number
- Why it represents this pattern well
- One-line hint (no full solution)

### 9. Connected Patterns
What patterns are adjacent to this one or build on it?

Be direct. No fluff. Focus on recognition and intuition.
